# Getting Started


:::tip Code Access

At this point, you should have successfully cloned the code if you had access.

:::


## Installation

Once cloned, cd into the project folder and run installation command 

```bash
cd /project-folder
npm install
```

## Environment Setup

### Step 1
Make a new `.env.local` file at the root using `.env.example` file.

### Step 2
- Add an `AUTH_SECRET` to use Next-Auth by running `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Add a postgres `DATABASE_URL`. Easiest would to be get a Supabase URL, cos I used Supabase as the DB with Drizzle ORM.

### Step 3
- Create a Google and Github Apps and get `client-id` and `client-secret`.
- Once you get the client id and secret, you should populate these 4 env variables for Next-Auth `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID, AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET, AUTH_GITHUB_ID, AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`

### Step 4
- First create this `REDIRECT_URI` env variables value `http://localhost:3000/apps/google-calendar/api/callback`.
- Now we will create one more Google OAuth App for our calendar integration, we will follow the same approach as `Google OAuth App` and get the client-id and secret.
- Make sure to add `REDIRECT_URI`as callback url while creating OAuth App and also `Enable calendar APIs` for your oauth app. 
- Once you get client-id and secret add them to these env variables `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_OAUTH_ID, GOOGLE_CALENDAR_OAUTH_SECRET`.

### Step 5
- As a last-step create an openai API key and add it to `OPENAI_API_KEY`

With this your env-setup should be complete ðŸ”¥.
