# Running 


Once the `env` setup is done, its time to run the project


## Preparing the DB 

Before we can run the app, we need to generate and migrate our DB schema written on drizzle

Generate migrations
```bash
npm run db:generate 
```

Apply generated migrations
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

You can also check out the Drizzle UI to check your DB locally. 
```bash
npm run db:ui
```
This will run your DB on https://local.drizzle.studio?port=3003

## Running the project

Once the DB is ready, you can simply run the following command and run your project on PORT 3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## App flow
-   If everything is in place you should be able to see your project running at PORT 3000, if you click `try now` button you should be navigated to `login` page.
-   On the `login` page you can either do `google` or `github` social-login.
-   Inorder to chat with your calendar, first go to `/apps` page and install `google-calendar` app which takes your through an OAuth Flow.
-   Once done, you can come back to `/chat`, select the app that you wanna chat with and use it to CREATE, DELETE, UPDATE and READ your Google Calendar meetings.
